This is an alternative to how a website of [Louvre Museum](https://www.louvre.fr/en) in Paris might look like.

**Stack: HTML, SASS, Javascript**

Here you can see:
* a slider (in the Welcome section),
* a slider before/after (in the Explore section),
* a custom video player, an art gallery with animation,
* a ticket cost calculator, a ticket purchase form with validation of input fields (available by pressing the "Buy Now" button in the Tickets section),
* an section with the parallax-effect,
* interactive map (implemented using [Mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/)).

The site is adaptive for screens from 1920px to 320px.
